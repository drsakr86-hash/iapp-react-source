 * The single Supabase client for the whole application.
 * -------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Configuration mirrors v2/iapp-core.js exactly. Each option was chosen for
 * a reason in the legacy app; changing any of them here changes behaviour
 * the existing backend depends on:
 *
 *   db.schema: 'iapp'      — application tables live in the iapp schema, not
 *                            public. public.profiles is reached explicitly
 *                            via .schema('public').
 *   persistSession         — session survives reload; required for the
 *                            session-restoration requirement.
 *   autoRefreshToken       — long clinic sessions must not expire mid-visit.
 *   detectSessionInUrl:false — no magic-link/OAuth callback flow is in use;
 *                            leaving it on makes the client parse and strip
 *                            URL fragments the router owns.
 *
 * Nothing else in the app may call createClient. One client means one
 * session, one Realtime socket, and one place to swap in generated types.

 * -------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * While src/types/database.types.ts is the placeholder, the client cannot
 * infer a row shape, so PostgREST's generic union (including its error
 * shape) is what comes back and a direct `as Row` cast is rejected.
 *
 * These three helpers concentrate that cast into one file instead of
 * scattering `as unknown as T` across every service. They are a marker, not
 * a solution: once `supabase gen types` has been run, the compiler will
 * infer real shapes, these become no-ops, and every call site can drop them.
 * Until then, nothing here is type-checked against the database — which is
 * exactly why generating the types is still the top of the list.
